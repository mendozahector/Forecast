# Forecast
My personal weather forecast using RESTful APIs and User Defaults for persistive data storage.

- Core Location used to obtain current user's location.
- Current weather is displayed  with a 5 day forecast (obtained from  OpenWeatherMap API).
- Using Alamofire and SwiftyJSON for easy GET request and JSON parsing of data.
- Users are able to add city names to interactive list (swipe for deletion).
